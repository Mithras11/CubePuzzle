# CubePuzzle

You have four colored cubes.
Each side of each cube is a single color, and there are four
colors: blue (B), red (R), green (G) and yellow (Y).

Describing the six faces as front, back,
left, right, top, bottom, the cube colors are:
Cube Front Back Left Right Top Bottom 
1     R     B    G     Y     B    Y 
2     R     G    G     Y     B    B 
3     Y     B    R     G     Y    R
4     Y     G    B     R     R    R


The objective is to find ways to stack the four cubes as a vertical column so that each side of
the column is showing all four colors.
